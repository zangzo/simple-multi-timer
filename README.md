# simple-multi-timer
Timer realisation for android on python using kivy libraries. My first phone app.

New skills: Kivy/KivyMD libraries, UI for android, creating APK file with Buildozer, debaging.

This timer is not working in background, because I didn't implement services conection for it. 
Regular aplication always paused in background.
